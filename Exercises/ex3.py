#Start by explaining the chicken count.
print("I will now count my chickens:")

#This math counts the two types of chickens; hens and roosters.
print("Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0)
print("Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0)

#Now explain that you're counting eggs.
print("Now I will count the eggs:")

#Actually count the eggs using arbitrary math.
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

#Now for a math question - answer to follow.
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

#Print the solution as its calculated.
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

#Two items: Ask a question and immediately answer it by performing the math.
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

#Be silly
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

#Continue to be silly.
print("How about some more.")

#Same as lines 21-22 - print a question immediately followed by its calculation.
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
